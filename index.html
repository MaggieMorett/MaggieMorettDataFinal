	<p1 class="center"> There is no more common and unconscious activity than breathing. We breathe <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1SdFjna7zQ" target="_blank"> every 3 seconds, 28,000 breathings everyday </a>. We could survive days without eating and drinking water, <a href="https://elpais.com/america-futura/2023-11-04/nos-ahogamos-asi-nos-mata-respirar-aire-contaminado.html" target="_blank"> but we couldn’t survive more than a few minutes without breathing</a>. Air it’s critical in our lives, nevertheless <a href="https://www.who.int/es/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/ambient-(outdoor)-air-quality-and-health" target="_blank"> air pollution affects 99% of the population worldwide.</a> Each respire comes with  different contaminants, nitrogen dioxide, fine particles and ozone, just to name a few. This analysis explores the Community Boards in Manhattan that had the best air quality in summer 2022, the first summer without COVID restrictions, only considering two contaminants: ozone and nitrogen dioxide. </p1>
<p></p>
<p1 class="center"> Even though, no matter the geographical zone, every point is polluted, there are areas in which the pollution is less than others. For example the map shows that the most polluted Community Board is number 5, Midtown; while the least polluted is number 12, Washington Heights. It is also noticeable that in south parts of Manhattan the pollution is higher than in the north. </p1>

<p1 class="center"> One of many contaminants that are present in New York City are Nitrogen dioxide and Ozone. In this graphic it can be seen that the most present is Ozone with 30 parts per billion (ppb) on average, and Nitrogen dioxide is above 15 parts per billion (ppb). Finally, the average of both is approximately 23 ppb.</p1>
